## Project Title: AHT Reduction Initiative - Telecommunications Company

**Project Duration:** 4 months

**Role:** Yellow Belt Project Manager

### Overview
Collaborating closely with the Telecommunications Company's Black Belt Project Manager, I contributed to a Six Sigma project aimed at optimizing operational efficiency. Our primary focus was on reducing the Average Handling Time (AHT) for the customer service operations. Working within the cross-functional team and applying Six Sigma methodologies, we aimed to streamline processes, enhance customer satisfaction, and potentially realize cost savings of up to $2 million annually.

### My Responsibilities

**1. Project Initiation (Month 1):**
- Assisted the Black Belt Project Manager in understanding the unique challenges of the telecommunications industry and aligning project objectives with the company's goals.
- Supported in defining the project scope, objectives, and success criteria tailored to the telecommunications context.

**2. Data Collection and Analysis (Month 1 - Month 2):**
- Collaborated with the Black Belt and IT teams to collect accurate data on current AHT, call volumes, and other relevant metrics, taking into account the specifics of telecommunications operations.
- Helped analyze the data to calculate baseline cost savings and identified opportunities for improvement.

**3. Root Cause Analysis (Month 2):**
- Collaborated with the Black Belt and the cross-functional team, utilizing tools such as Process Mapping, Fishbone Diagrams, and Pareto Analysis to identify root causes affecting AHT in the telecommunications context.
- Participated in discussions to uncover challenges unique to the telecommunications customer service environment.

**4. Solution Development and Prioritization (Month 2 - Month 3):**
- Engaged in brainstorming sessions to generate innovative solutions tailored to the telecommunications industry's dynamics.
- Assisted in evaluating and prioritizing solutions using a Decision Matrix, considering factors relevant to telecommunications operations.

**5. Solution Implementation (Month 3):**
- Worked closely with the Black Belt in coordinating the implementation of selected solutions with IT, training departments, and process owners, taking into account the nuances of telecommunications systems.
- Supported the rollout of optimized training programs, software workflow enhancements, and communication improvements specific to telecommunications services.

**6. Monitoring and Measurement (Month 3 - Month 4):**
- Assisted in closely monitoring changes in AHT and related metrics as the selected solutions were introduced, considering the unique characteristics of telecommunications customer interactions.
- Collaborated with the team to ensure the targeted reduction in AHT was consistently achieved, adjusting strategies as needed.

**7. Analysis and Standardization (Month 4):**
- Contributed to analyzing results to confirm that the desired AHT reduction was consistently achieved within the telecommunications environment.
- Assisted in standardizing the new processes, procedures, and training materials, tailored to the specific challenges of telecommunications operations.

**8. Control Measures and Communication (Month 4):**
- Supported the implementation of control measures that aligned with the telecommunications landscape, ensuring AHT remained within the target range over time.
- Assisted in effectively communicating the project's success and the achieved cost savings, emphasizing the impact on the telecommunications company's operations.

**9. Project Completion (Month 4):**
- Participated in a project retrospective to gather feedback and insights, considering the telecommunications industry's particular challenges and opportunities.
- Contributed to documenting the comprehensive project process, including the telecommunications-specific lessons learned and accomplishments.

### Results
Collaborating as a Yellow Belt Project Manager alongside the Black Belt Project Manager, we achieved a successful reduction in AHT from 8 minutes to 6 minutes within the telecommunications environment. This initiative not only led to substantial potential cost savings of up to $2 million annually but also enhanced customer satisfaction by delivering more efficient and responsive customer service tailored to telecommunications needs.

### My Role's Impact
In my role as a Yellow Belt Project Manager, I was a vital part of the collaborative effort alongside the Black Belt and the cross-functional team. Through my contributions, I helped adapt Six Sigma methodologies to the unique challenges of the telecommunications industry. My responsibilities encompassed data analysis, solution development support, implementation oversight, and results tracking, all while considering the nuances of telecommunications customer interactions. This experience underscores my ability to adapt and contribute to projects within specific industry contexts while driving improvements that align with strategic objectives.
